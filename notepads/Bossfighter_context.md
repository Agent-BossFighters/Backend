BOSS FIGHTERS is an asymmetrical multiplayer action game where one player with or without a VR headset takes the role of the powerful Boss monster, while other players team up against it - all battle for spectators' amusement, ranks, and valuable loot.

Embark to online multiplayer! This is an asymmetrical co-op shooter bred with the physics sandbox experience to create a unique, innovative game to shake the gaming landscape!

Physics-based Boss player’s gameplay, the sense of scale and power while controlling the giant Boss, is set against the teamwork, cunning, and agility of the team of Fighters.

Hop on to free-to-play battles as Boss or Fighter, to become a futuristic superstar gladiator, to win valuable items, skins, and other rewards.

The game is essentially free-to-play, so almost all items can be received for gameplay activities or bought with in-game currency. However, players who wish to embrace the advantages of blockchain technology are able to expand their success, earn valuable digital collectibles, and compete for prize pools.

BOSS FIGHTERS is developed by Pixward Games, where top-class artists, designers, and battle-hardened VR developers create ground-breaking innovative VR & Blockchain games. Character Stats System
In BOSS FIGHTERS, the depth of gameplay is significantly enriched by a comprehensive Character Stats System, which intricately defines the capabilities and strategic potential of Fighters and Bosses alike. This system not only tailors each character's role within the game but also introduces a layer of customization that can influence the outcome of battles. Understanding these stats, their applications, and how they interact with equipment and Perks is essential for every player aiming to master the game. Let's break down the Power Stats for Fighters and Bosses, along with the shared Value Stats that influence rewards.

Note: The lists below are subject to change with the game evolving.

Play as a BOSS
Playing as the Boss means one can catch and throw Fighters, break objects, and use environmental props as blunt weapons. In addition, the Boss has access to a special set of gear to roast enemies with various deadly weapons.

The game features two ways to play as a Boss — using a VR headset or just on a PC.

1. VR Boss
Physics-based gameplay and destruction powers of the Boss - make the world and interactions much more believable and enjoyable for VR players, elevating the VR experience to a new peak, never seen before in any VR play-to-own game.

To move as Boss in VR in BOSS FIGHTERS you have to grab the environment with a controller (hand) and actively pull yourself to the grabbing point. Essentially, this feels like pulling the world towards yourself.

Before the battle, you can calibrate the height with a special option.

Player height is calibrated to position Boss claws (VR player's hands) on the ground level - this means that a standing player with relaxed arms can easily reach the ground and grab any object or surface.

The Boss can climb buildings using the same method - pulling oneself towards and over the object.

You'll harness GRIP mechanics to attack and interact within the arena, allowing you to grab and throw objects or Fighters.

Your arsenal includes Melee, Ranged, and Zone Control Weapons, each suited for different strategies.

You have the power to demolish parts of the arena, opening up new pathways or creating obstacles for strategic advantages.

2. PC Boss
Playing as a Boss on PC gives a similar experience. You act from the 1st-person point of view, navigating through the map using a keyboard and mouse. All the same actions and possibilities as in VR are available to you as a PC Boss player.

Play as a FIGHTER
As a Fighter you navigate the battle arena, looking for supplies and ammunition to recharge weapons and abilities, complete objectives, and attack The Boss. Fighters are armed with all kinds of heavy weapons, explosives, and gadgets and have to cooperate, and use team play and personal skills to defeat powerful Boss.

Movement and Controls: You'll navigate using the classic WASD keys for movement, with the mouse to aim and shoot, or you can opt for a gamepad if that's more your style.

Combat Arsenal: You're equipped with an array of weapons, each offering limited ammo that demands thoughtful use and careful management.

Special Abilities: You'll have access to abilities such as Double Leap and Blink, giving you the edge in mobility and opening up new strategic plays.

1. Fighter Power Stats
Fighters boast a set of power stats that outline their health, damage potential, and battlefield mobility among other capabilities. Here's a look at each:

HP (Health Points) - determines the character's total health.

HP Regen - the rate at which health is recovered per second.

Move Speed - how quickly a character moves across the battlefield.

Critical Hit Damage - the multiplier applied to damage when landing critical hits.

Damage Reduction - reduces incoming damage from all sources.

Orb Duration - extends the effect duration of orbs.

Orb Power - amplifies the impact of orbs.

Pick-up Power - enhances the effectiveness of pick-ups.

Ammo Capacity - increases the max ammo or energy capacity for weapons and tools.

Shooting Speed - the firing rate of any weapon.

Cooldown - the recharge time required for gadgets to be used again.

All Damage Bonus - a general multiplier enhancing all inflicted damage.

Dispersion Reduction - decreases weapon spread, improving accuracy.

2. Boss Power Stats
Boss stats include HP, HP Regen, Move Speed, Critical Hit Damage, Damage Reduction, Orb Duration, Orb Power, Ammo Capacity, Shooting Speed, Cooldown, and All Damage Bonus, similar to Fighters but tailored to their role and capabilities in battle. But also there are several parameters that highlight their difference from Fighters:

Shield Cooldown - time required for shield regeneration.

Energy - the Boss's reserve for weapons usage.

Throw Damage - damage multiplier for throwing Fighters.

Rage Duration - length of time the Rage mode lasts.

Jump Cooldown - recovery time between jumps.

3. Value Stats
Both fighters and Bosses benefit from four additional stats, which directly impact the rewards earned from matches:

$BFT Bonus - increases the $BFT Token rewards from matches. This applies only if a BADGE is equipped.

FLEX Bonus - boosts the FLEX rewards from matches.

Reinforcers Bonus - enhances rewards of Reinforcers from matches.

Variators Bonus - increases the number of Variators rewarded from matches.

4. Equipment and Perks Interaction
The character stats can be further modified and optimized through equipment and Perks. Different types of equipment, such as a Fighter's body, can override base stat values, providing strategic choices in build-making. Perks offer another layer of customization, allowing you to modify stats to better align with your gameplay style and strategies.

The character stats system in BOSS FIGHTERS offers a rich tapestry for customization and strategic depth, allowing you to finely tune your characters to your preferred playstyle. Whether you're optimizing a Fighter for speed and agility or bolstering a Boss with formidable defensive stats, understanding and leveraging these stats is key to dominating the battleground. Equip your characters wisely, and let the synergy between your chosen stats, equipment, and Perks guide you to victory.

Perks System
Perks play a crucial role in defining and enhancing the capabilities of your items, whether they're in-game assets or coveted Digital Collectibles. Understanding the nuances of how Perks function, their rarities, and the distinction between Power and Value Perks can significantly influence your strategic approach to the game. This article gives an overview of the intricate world of Perks, guiding you through their acquisition, functionality, and impact on gameplay. Power Perks

3. Power Perks bonuses to stats
Each Power Perk has a rarity. The rarity of the perk defines its impact on stats. This impact is measured in points from 100 to 1000 with a step of 100 points per rarity. Stars can further improve the perk by a certain amount of points. If more than one perk of the same type is equipped, their points sum up and further empower the corresponding character's stat (e.g., Common HP and Uncommon HP perks give 300 points in total, so if both are equipped, they give the same effect as one Rare HP perk). 

1. Acquisition of Perks
Perks are bestowed upon items through two primary processes: Crafting and Merging on odd rarities. Each item in BOSS FIGHTERS is eligible for a unique set of possible Perks, with the appearance chances of these Perks varying. The excitement of discovering a Perk on your item is further amplified by the Perk's rarity, which is influenced by the item's resulting rarity post-merge. As you ascend to higher rarities, the likelihood of encountering rarer Perks increases.

2. Power and Value Perks
There are two distinct types of Perks: Power and Value.

Power Perks are the bedrock of both in-game assets and Digital Collectibles, acting as passive bonuses that amplify your character's stats in various ways. Conversely, Value Perks are exclusive to Digital Collectibles and bring an active component to gameplay. Each Value Perk requires the completion of a specific task within a match to activate.

Example:

A Value Perk on a Striker, which gives a $BFT Token Bonus, comes with a task "Deal 500 damage to Boss using Striker". This means that the $BFT bonus will be applied at the end of the match only if the task is completed during this match.

3. Functionality and Impact
Perks in BOSS FIGHTERS are not mere static bonuses; they introduce points to the stats they affect. These points accumulate from identical Perks across all items a player possesses, leading to stat increases. This system ensures that every Perk, no matter how small, contributes to your overall strategic advantage.

Example:

A Legendary Power Perk on a Striker, which gives an All Damage Bonus, comes with 500 points.

An Epic Power Perk on a Hook, which gives an All Damage Bonus, comes with 400 points.

These two perks together give 900 points to the "All Damage Bonus" stat which further converts into a certain % of bonus damage that will be displayed in the character's parameters.

A table with exact numbers for all stats will be added later.

4. Star Upgrades
Upon Merging items at odd rarities, Perks have the opportunity to receive Star Upgrades, ranging from one to three stars. These upgrades offer an additional bonus of points, further enhancing the Perk's impact on your character's performance.

Stars

The table is subject to change with further development of the game.

Perks in BOSS FIGHTERS are a dynamic and integral component of the game's strategic depth. They offer players the ability to customize and enhance their characters and items in a way that aligns with their gameplay style and objectives. Whether you're focusing on Power Perks to maximize your character's stats or engaging with Value Perks to unlock the farming potential of your items, the Perks System provides a rich tapestry of possibilities. Embrace the challenge of acquiring and optimizing Perks, and let them guide you to victory in the thrilling battles of BOSS FIGHTERS. Value Perks
Value Perks act as passive bonuses that amplify your character's farming abilities. Below are detailed lists of such perks and a general overview of their mechanics.

1. Value Perks types
Value Perks are the same both for Fighters and Bosses. There are 4 types of Value Perks:

$BFT Bonus - multiplies the $BFT reward after the match generated by equipped BADGEs.

FLEX Bonus - gives a certain amount of FLEX as an additional reward at the end of each match.

Variator Bonus - increases the amount of Reinforcers in match rewards.

Reinforcer Bonus - increases the amount of Reinforcers in match rewards.

2. Value Perks mechanics
Each Value Perk comes with a random task that you have to complete during the match to activate the perk's effect on rewards.

For example: there is a common $BFT Bonus perk with a task "Deal 500 Critical Damage" and an uncommon FLEX Bonus perk with a task "Knock down the shield 5 times". You completed the 1st task but didn't complete the 2nd one. In this situation, at the end of the match, you will get a bonus of $BFT reward (if a BADGE is equipped)  but no FLEX will be given.

If several Value Perks have the same task, you'll need to complete it only once during the match to trigger all the perks.

Each item can have up to 5 Value Perks. Perks can repeat or be different. Any perk can appear on any item, but certain tasks can appear only on certain items (the detailed list will be attached later).

Possible tasks for Fighters:

Deal 750 damage

Deal 500 critical damage

Deal 1000 damage with Slime Lobber

Deal 1000 damage with Rail Gun

Deal 1000 damage with Striker

Deal 500 critical damage with Slime Lobber

Deal 500 critical damage with Rail Gun

Deal 500 critical damage with Striker

Hit the boss's weak spot 10 times

Knock down the shield 5 times

Deal 250 damage during the Rage

Escape the boss's claw 5 times

Knock an ally out of a boss's claw 3 times

Die no more than 2 times

Pick up 5 orbs

Deal 500 damage of Physical type

Deal 500 damage of Energy type

Deal 500 damage of Toxic type

Win the match

TBA

Possible tasks for Bosses:

Deal 1000 damage

Catch 10 fighters

Kill 10 fighters with Laser

Kill 10 fighters with Toxic Gun

Kill 10 fighters with Spiker Maul

Kill 10 fighters with Seismic Hammer

Kill 5 fighters during the Rage

Kill 5 fighters using the environment

Deal 500 damage using the environment

Pick up 10 orbs

Win the match

Deal 500 damage to fighters by throwing them

Kill 5 fighters with throws

Block 20 projectiles

Catch 5 fighters in the air

TBA

While the efficiency of Value Perks grows with their Rarity, the complexity of tasks doesn't depend on Perks's Rarity and remains the same.

Note that the numbers in these tasks are just examples and they will be different in the game.

3. Value Perks bonuses to rewards
Each Value Perk has a rarity. The rarity of the perk defines its impact on stats. This impact is measured in points from 100 to 1000 with a step of 100 points per rarity. Stars can further improve the perk by a certain amount of points. If more than one perk of the same type is equipped, their points sum up and further empower the corresponding character's stat (e.g., Common $BFT Bonus and Uncommon $BFT Bonus perks give 300 points in total, so if both are equipped, they give the same effect as one Rare $BFT Bonus perk).

The graphic below shows the potential power growth of perks (no matter if one equipped perk gives this value or several) when a certain amount of points is reached.

Game Economy Overview

Traditionally, gamers acquired cosmetic items and other virtual goods from in-game NPCs (Non-Player Characters), which could not be traded or given to other players, often leading to an oversupply of these items within the game itself.

BOSS FIGHTERS is transitioning towards an economy owned by players, empowering them to play, collect, create, trade, or even lend out rare utility collectibles. BOSS FIGHTERS restores control to the players by establishing a marketplace entirely operated by them, with rarity and uniqueness inherent to each digital collectible. Whether one decides to focus on gathering resources or crafting items, the possibilities are limitless.

1. Introduction to the Economy
BOSS FIGHTERS is not just a game; it's an ecosystem where every battle, every decision, and every strategy can have economic implications. The game ingeniously combines the thrill of real-time multiplayer action with the financial strategies of Web 3.0, creating a play-to-own framework that rewards your skills and strategic thinking.

2. Crafting and Trading: Basic Principles

At the heart of BOSS FIGHTERS' economy is the concept of crafting and trading. Imagine taking the loot you've bravely earned in the arena and transforming it into digital collectibles. These aren't just trophies but tangible assets that can enhance your gaming experience and status within our community. Through crafting, you turn gameplay efforts into valuable digital collectibles. By engaging in merging, you can further enhance these items, making them even more valuable.

3. Monetizing Your Skills With Utility Collectibles
Our economy offers multiple ways to monetize your playtime:

Utilize BADGEs to Collect $BFT Tokens: Participate in the game using the BADGE, a Pure Utility digital collectible, to collect $BFT tokens along with other rewards. You can craft BADGEs through SHOWRUNNER CONTRACT or receive them via airdrops and events.

Trade and Boost Your Earnings: Transform your in-game items into digital collectibles for trading, which not only allows you to profit from your efforts but also boosts the generation of $BFT tokens, adding an extra layer of strategy and reward to your gameplay.

Lease Your Assets for Passive Income: Offer your digital collectibles, like BADGEs, SHOWRUNNER CONTRACTs, and STADIUMs rights, for lease to other players, opening up another avenue for revenue. $BFT Token
At the heart of the BOSS FIGHTERS universe lies the $BFT token, an integral component that fuels a wide range of activities within the game. From crafting unique Digital Collectibles to unlocking exclusive content, $BFT tokens are pivotal in shaping your journey and the game's economy. With a fixed maximum supply, the value of $BFT tokens is meticulously designed to increase in tandem with the growth of our player base, ensuring that each token remains a valuable asset in your gaming arsenal.

1. The Sense of the $BFT Token
Engaging with $BFT tokens means embarking on a multifaceted adventure of Сrafting, Merging, and participating in the game activities. Every action you undertake is a step forward in your personal journey, contributing to the richness of BOSS FIGHTERS' economy. With a cap of 1,000,000,000 tokens, the majority of $BFT tokens will be generated through gameplay, rewarding players who actively participate with equipped BADGEs.

2. Acquiring $BFT Tokens
Acquiring $BFT tokens is straightforward and can be achieved through two primary methods:

You can receive $BFT tokens as rewards for participating in battles, provided you have at least one BADGE or DISPOSABLE BADGE equipped.

You can import $BFT tokens into the game via your crypto wallets.

3. Using $BFT Tokens
The utility of $BFT tokens extends beyond mere currency, serving as the backbone for several critical game mechanics:

Crafting new Digital Collectibles and upgrading existing ones to higher rarity tiers require $BFT tokens.

Entering the Arena Mode and participating in competitive battles necessitates purchasing Arena Invites with $BFT tokens.

Holding $BFT tokens in the vault unlocks access to gated content, including exclusive tournaments and rewards, enriching your gaming experience.

4. Trading $BFT Tokens
While $BFT tokens cannot be traded directly within BOSS FIGHTERS or on the OpenLoot marketplace, they embody the flexibility of cryptocurrency. Players can export $BFT tokens to their crypto wallets from OpenLoot, enabling them to engage in standard cryptocurrency operations. This includes trading on external exchanges or transferring tokens, offering players complete control over their $BFT assets. Resources
Resources play a pivotal role in defining your gameplay strategy and progression. From engaging in battles to Crafting and Merging items, understanding the various types of resources and their applications is crucial for every player. This list will provide you with a comprehensive overview of each resource, their methods of acquisition, and their primary uses within the game.

Cash — the primary currency in BOSS FIGHTERS, facilitating most transactions and processes within the game. You can earn Cash through match rewards, purchase it with FLEX, or acquire it via the Trophy Road and Season Pass. Its versatility makes it essential for Crafting and Merging items, acting as the backbone of the game's economy.

FLEX — the hard currency in BOSS FIGHTERS, offering additional flexibility and options for players looking to enhance their gameplay. It can be earned under specific conditions in matches, through in-game events, the Trophy Road, the Season Pass, or directly purchased within the game. FLEX is crucial for Crafting and Recharging BADGEs, and locking Perks during the Merging process.

$BFT Token — a currency that integrates the game with the broader digital economy. Available for purchase on exchanges, earned through matches with an equipped BADGE, or via live activities. The $BFT Token is key for crafting and merging Digital Collectibles, buying Arena Invites, and securing airdrops by holding tokens in the vault.

Reinforcer — an item that is used specifically for rerolling stars when upgrading Perks. This item can be only earned as a match reward and is vital for players looking to maximize the efficacy of their items' Perks.

Variator — an item that allows you to reroll a Perk upon acquiring a new one. This item can be obtained only as a match reward and provides you with the chance to customize your items' Perks.

Fusion Core — a key resource for Crafting and Merging Digital Collectibles of "Rare" rarity and above. It can be acquired only via Dismantling Digital Collectibles you don't need anymore.

Sponsor Marks — a currency that is required for Merging BADGEs and leveling up the passive bonuses of SHOWRUNNER CONTRACTs. It can be earned through Crafting and Merging Digital Collectibles or traded on OpenLoot. Crafting System
Crafting in BOSS FIGHTERS is a transformative experience that bridges the gap between in-game items and Digital Collectibles, imbuing them with both value and versatility. This pivotal process allows players to elevate their gameplay and actively participate in the game's economy. Whether you're looking to enhance your character's arsenal or trade valuable assets, understanding the crafting mechanism is key to maximizing your potential within BOSS FIGHTERS. Let's explore the ins and outs of crafting, from the basics of transformation to the intricacies of Value Perks.

Rarity System
The Rarity System is the foundational element that not only adds depth to your gameplay experience but also introduces a fascinating layer of strategy when it comes to collecting, trading, and utilizing items within the game. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or a newcomer eager to explore, understanding how rarity levels work will significantly enhance your journey. Let's dive in.

1. The Ladder of Rarity
In BOSS FIGHTER, every item falls into one of ten distinct rarity levels. These are, from the first to the last:

Common

Uncommon

Rare

Epic

Legendary

Mythic

Exalted

Exotic

Transcendent

Unique


This hierarchy affects not only the item's value and effectiveness but also its availability within the game world.

2. Items' Types and Supplies
Once an item is crafted (transformed into a digital collectible), it enters the market of BOSS FIGHTERS. Here's where the rarity system plays a pivotal role in dictating the scarcity and demand for these items. It works for all Utility items, whether Equipment or Characters and Bosses, Cosmetics, or Pure Utilities (even if this one already comes as a Digital Collectible).

This limit varies based on the item's category and rarity level, as outlined below:

Rarity
Characters and Equipment (per item type)

Examples:

While pure utilities are straightforward, let's take for example a Striker. According to the table above, only 500 Legendary Strikers can exist at once in the form of Digital Collectibles. Nonetheless, there can be more in-game items that are not Digital Collectibles and not tradable.

And the same works for Cosmetics. An Animal Striker is a cosmetic item (skin) for Striker and it has the "Rare" rarity. According to the table above, there could be up to 750 Animal Strikers at once in the form of digital collectibles.

The supply amounts in the table above are immutable and will never change.

3. Engaging with the Rarity System
Engaging with the rarity system opens up a myriad of possibilities. Whether you're questing for that elusive Unique BADGE or trading equipment to optimize your character's build, the rarity system enriches your interactions and decisions in the game.

Remember, every item's rarity is not only signifies its scarcity but also its potential impact on your power. As you collect and trade, you'll find that each rarity level brings its own set of challenges and rewards, making your journey in BOSS FIGHTERS uniquely exciting.

Utility Items
Utility Items, encompassing characters, bosses, weapons, tools, and gadgets, form the backbone of gameplay in BOSS FIGHTERS. These items not only tune your gameplay experience but also follow the Rarity system. Items progression allows you to both become stronger and get more rewards after matches. Understanding how Utility Items evolve and interact with the rarity system will significantly amplify your strategic planning and gameplay enjoyment. Let's delve into the mechanics and nuances of Utility Items within BOSS FIGHTERS.

1. The Journey from Game Asset to Digital Collectible
Initially, Utility Items in BOSS FIGHTERS are standard game assets, which can be enhanced up to the Mythic rarity level through the Merging system. However, the true potential of these items is unlocked when they are crafted into Digital Collectibles. This transformation enables them to ascend through the final four rarities — Exalted, Exotic, Transcendent, and Unique — each tier offering increasing levels of scarcity and value.


2. Rarity and Perk Progression of Utility Items
A distinctive feature of Utility Items is their Perk progression system, intricately tied to their rarity level:

Odd Rarities - introduce a new Perk, enhancing the utility and strategic value of the item.

Even Rarities - upgrade the previously introduced Perk, amplifying its effectiveness and utility in the game.

Utility Items can receive up to three Power Perks and up to five Value Perks throughout their progression. Power Perks directly impact gameplay, such as increasing damage output or enhancing character abilities. In contrast, Value Perks increase rewards after matches if requirements are met.


3. Utility Items Crafting
Crafting an item into a Digital Collectible is a pivotal moment in its lifecycle. Not only does this conversion allow the item to achieve the highest rarities, but it also enables the item to obtain Value Perks, making it a coveted asset in the BOSS FIGHTERS trading community. It's crucial to note that if an item is converted at any level other than common, all Value Perks are assigned randomly, not allowing you to carefully select them.

4. Strategy and Planning
Deciding when to convert your Utility Items into Digital Collectibles requires careful consideration. You must balance the immediate benefits of unlocking new Perks and rarities against the potential future usage of this item as a resource for improving another item. The decision can significantly affect your gameplay strategy, potentially turning the tide in competitive play or enhancing your standing in the game's community.

Utility Items in BOSS FIGHTERS are more than just tools for progression — they are assets that grow in value and utility, shaped by strategic decisions and progression through the game. Whether you're delving into matches with a Rare weapon, employing gadgets of Exotic rarity, or trading items of Transcendent value, these items enrich your journey in BOSS FIGHTERS.

Utility Cosmetics
Utility Cosmetics in BOSS FIGHTERS stand out as a vibrant category of items, offering players the unique opportunity to personalize their experience with a touch of style. These items allow players to alter the visual appearance of their Fighters, Bosses, and equipment, infusing a personal flair into the game. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, Utility Cosmetics unlock additional dimensions of gameplay when crafted into or acquired as Digital Collectibles. This article delves into the world of Utility Cosmetics, shedding light on their functionality, Rarity, and the Perks they bring to the game.

1. Aesthetic Choices with Strategic Depth
At their core, Utility Cosmetics provide an aesthetic choice, enabling players to change how an item looks without altering its inherent functions. These skins are directly tied to specific items, offering a wide range of visual customization options to reflect each player's style and preferences. From the sleek and modern to the fantastical and wild, Utility Cosmetics enhance the visual diversity of BOSS FIGHTERS, making every player's journey distinct and visually engaging.

2. Utility Cosmetics Crafting
The true potential of Utility Cosmetics is unveiled when they are either crafted into Digital Collectibles or acquired as such. Upon undergoing this transformation, Utility Cosmetics reveal their Value Perk — a feature that distinguishes them from ordinary cosmetics. While the cosmetic item itself can be of any rarity, the rarity of the Perk always aligns with that of the cosmetic item.

Utility Cosmetics add Value Perks on top of existing item Perks. When equipped, a Utility Cosmetic not only changes an item's appearance but also bestows additional benefits that enhance the item's utility. This layering of Perks allows players to strategically customize their gear for optimal performance.

Whether you're showcasing your latest rare skin in the arena or leveraging unique Perks to gain an edge in your performance, Utility Cosmetics add a rich layer of depth to the game's dynamic world. Embrace the creative and strategic possibilities of Utility Cosmetics, and let your personal style shine through in every aspect of BOSS FIGHTERS.

Pure Utilities
In BOSS FIGHTERS, you'll find three main types of Pure Utilities:

BADGE, which allows you to collect $BFT token rewards after matches;

SHOWRUNNER CONTRACT, which gives the ability to craft and recharge BADGEs;

STADIUM lets craft some amount of SHOWRUNNER CONTRACTs as well as enjoy discounts and enhanced rewards. This collectible also enhances your experience through the official Twitch Extension, adding a layer of interactive fun.

BADGE
In the dynamic world of BOSS FIGHTERS, BADGEs play a pivotal role in the game's economy and offer a unique way for players to earn $BFT tokens. These tokens are not just a currency within the game but a symbol of achievement and strategic gameplay. Understanding how BADGEs work, how they can be used to maximize your $BFT token rewards, and how they interact with the game's premium currency, FLEX, is crucial for participating in the game's economy. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about BADGEs in BOSS FIGHTERS.


1. The Role of BADGEs in Earning $BFT Tokens
BADGEs are essential for players aiming to collect $BFT tokens, the coveted reward currency of BOSS FIGHTERS. To start earning these tokens, you must equip at least one BADGE of any rarity. You can equip up to five various BADGEs simultaneously to maximize your token rewards. However, initially, only one slot is available for BADGEs, with additional slots unlockable using FLEX, the game's premium currency.


2. Operating Your BADGEs
While BADGEs are powerful tools for earning $BFT tokens, they come with limitations. Each BADGE has a limited number of matches it can participate in before its $BFT rewards are depleted. Once a BADGE is emptied, it must be recharged.

BADGEs can be merged, following the same process as Utility Items. This merging mechanism increases both BADGE's profitability and the amount of charges it can contain. By strategically merging BADGEs, you can enhance farming potential and achieve greater rewards in the game.

Note:

BADGE Base Efficiency means how one or another rarity performs compared to the common BADGE without any modifiers.

BADGE Charges means how many times a BADGE of this rarity can be recharged in a row to stack matches in it.

SHOWRUNNER CONTRACTs are integral to the BADGE ecosystem. These valuable items are used for both merging BADGEs to increase their profitability and recharging them to restore their $BFT rewards capacity. Understanding how to utilize CONTRACTs effectively is key to maximizing the benefits of your BADGEs and ensuring a steady flow of $BFT tokens.

DISPOSABLE BADGE
A unique facet of the BADGE system in BOSS FIGHTERS is the DISPOSABLE BADGE. This special type of BADGE offers a distinct set of characteristics:

DISPOSABLE BADGEs can only be obtained as rewards from matches or other in-game activities.

Unlike regular BADGEs, DISPOSABLE BADGEs come pre-charged for a specific number of matches and cannot be recharged. Once their utility is exhausted, they disappear.

These BADGEs also feature a timer, adding a time-sensitive aspect to their use. You must strategically decide when to deploy them to maximize your benefits before they vanish.

DISPOSABLE BADGEs cannot be traded or rented, emphasizing their role as a personal reward and strategic asset that players must manage individually.

SHOWRUNNER CONTRACT
SHOWRUNNER CONTRACTs are a cornerstone of strategic gameplay in BOSS FIGHTERS, offering players a multifaceted approach to crafting, merging, and recharging BADGEs. These CONTRACTs, adhering to the game's established Rarity ladder, open up a world of possibilities for players aiming to enhance their BADGE collections and, by extension, their farming strategies. Let's delve into the mechanics of SHOWRUNNER CONTRACTs and how they can be utilized to gain an edge in BOSS FIGHTERS.


1. Crafting and Merging BADGEs using CONTRACTs
At the heart of SHOWRUNNER CONTRACTs is the ability to craft and merge BADGEs. Crafting a new BADGE begins at the common level, requiring only a designated amount of FLEX, BOSS FIGHTER's premium currency. However, as players set their sights on higher rarities, the process becomes more intricate. To create a BADGE of superior rarity, players must amalgamate several BADGEs of the preceding rarity, a specific amount of FLEX, and Sponsor Marks — a special currency tied to the crafting system.

While CONTRACTs enable the crafting and merging of BADGEs up to their own rarity, it's crucial to note that CONTRACTs themselves cannot be merged. This limitation ensures that each CONTRACT's value and utility are maximized through strategic use rather than consolidation.

2. Recharging BADGEs
Recharging BADGEs is a vital process for maintaining their efficacy in earning $BFT rewards. This necessitates a balance of resources — FLEX and Sponsor Marks — and time. The base recharge time can be expedited with additional FLEX, allowing players to quickly return their BADGEs to active duty.

3. CONTRACT's Passive Bonuses
Each CONTRACT comes equipped with a passive bonus, which can significantly influence the crafting and recharging processes. These bonuses vary in type, including but not limited to:

Chance to craft a higher rarity BADGE - elevates the possibility of crafting a BADGE one rarity above the expected rarity (can even overcome the CONTRACT's rarity).

Chance to craft a BADGE for free - offers an opportunity to get back used currencies for the BADGE crafting.

Recharge speed up - reduces the waiting time for BADGE recharging.

Recharge discount - lowers the cost of resources for recharging BADGEs.

TBA

The level and power of these bonuses can be increased using Sponsor Marks, with the potential for multiple level-ups depending on the CONTRACT's rarity.


3.1 Sponsor Marks
Sponsor Marks are integral to enhancing CONTRACTs and, by extension, the BADGEs players craft and recharge. These Marks can be obtained through the Utility Items and Cosmetics Crafting and Merging system, rewarding players who actively engage in enhancing their BADGE collections.

SHOWRUNNER CONTRACTs in BOSS FIGHTERS represent a dynamic component of the game's economic and strategic ecosystem. They not only facilitate the crafting and merging of BADGEs but also offer unique bonuses that can be leveraged to optimize gameplay. Whether you're aiming to expedite the recharge process or hoping to craft higher rarity BADGEs, understanding and utilizing SHOWRUNNER CONTRACTs will undoubtedly enrich your BOSS FIGHTERS experience. Embrace the complexities of CONTRACTs, and let them guide you to strategic success within the game's vibrant world.

GAME SHARES
GAME SHARES are unique Collectibles with utility that grows as you acquire more of them. They are essential for:

Participating in valuable Collectibles (such as SHOWRUNNER CONTRACTS) and Resource distribution rounds.

Gaining access to purchase exclusive STADIUMS.

The supply of GAME SHARES is 10.000 items and immutable.


1. GAME SHARES functionality
Owning at least one GAME SHARE grants access to a special section on economy.bossfighters.game. This portal provides detailed insights into Game Share utilities. Here’s how it works: 

Distribution Rounds. GAME SHARES grant access to periodic reward events, where assets such as SHOWRUNNER CONTRACT's, rare Collectibles, FLEX Packs, CASH, and even $BFT tokens are distributed. The size and quality of these rewards grow with the game’s player base and activity levels.

Community Progress. Rewards are tied to collective progress, tracked through a dynamic progress bar that fills as players battle, craft, rank up, and invite others to join. The more active the community, the better the rewards for GAME SHARES holders.

Higher Ownership = Greater Rewards. The more GAME SHARES you hold, the higher your chances of earning top-tier items. Plus, you can actively boost your odds by crafting Collectibles, winning battles, and recruiting new players.


2. Rewards acquisition
The community's collective progress is displayed through a progress bar, which fills as players engage in the Boss Fighters game and economy. Actions such as battling, crafting items, ranking up, and expanding the player base contribute to progress. The goal target for each round adjusts dynamically based on the total player count and activity levels, ensuring a balanced incentive structure. Once the progress bar is filled, a Distribution Event is triggered, and a new round begins with a slightly higher community goal.

Players with at least one GAME SHARE can view their reward probabilities and the specific resources they might earn. To qualify for rewards, players must play a number of battles during the current Distribution Round and collect a certain amount of $BFT rewards.

You can improve your chances to win rewards of the current round by: 

Playing and winning battles: Small increase.

Inviting new players via referral links: Moderate increase (once referrals reach a specific level).

Owning more GAME SHARES: Moderate increase.

Crafting Collectible items: Major increase.

Potential rewards:

Showrunner Contracts (Common to Exalted)

Legendary and higher-tier Collectible items

Cosmetic Collectibles

FLEX (Premium Currency)

Fusion Cores

Sponsor Marks

Cash

$BFT

Other assets and resources

Game Share owners always receive FLEX, Cash, and Sponsor Marks in varying amounts during Distribution Events.

3. Exclusive Access to STADIUMs
Stadium NFTs are a rare and precious asset, and GAME SHARES are the only way to acquire them. Here's how works:

Purchase Stadiums with GAME SHARES

To buy a Stadium, you must spend GAME SHARES.

Once spent, these GAME SHARES return to a pool, allowing them to be redistributed through leaderboards, Distribution Rounds, and other events.

Limited Supply

Only 10,000 GAME SHARES exist, with a total of 1,876 STADIUMs available.

Rarity and GAME SHARE Costs

Stadiums come in six rarities, starting at Legendary and scaling upwards.

Higher rarity Stadiums require more GAME SHARES and offer enhanced utilities and features.

STADIUM
STADIUMs are one of the pure utility assets in Boss Fighters, designed to maximize your impact on the game's economy. Perfect for guild leaders, streamers, or ambitious players. STADIUMs are exclusive assets purchasable only with GAME SHARES. Available in rarities from Legendary to Unique, higher-tier STADIUMs require more GAME SHARES and provide more significant benefits.

1. Key utilities of STADIUMs
STADIUMs offer unmatched benefits, including:

Stadium Store - access exclusive game assets at discounted rates using Fame Points.

Gaming Show Features -  engage your audience during live streams with interactive tools that influence gameplay in real-time.

Customization Options - personalize your arena with branding, banners, and colors.

Guild Management Tools (coming soon) -  co-own and manage STADIUMs with your community.


2. STADIUMs availability
Stadiums come in six rarities, each influencing the benefits and customization they provide.

With only 1,876 Stadiums globally, they are as scarce as they are impactful, making ownership a true mark of prestige in the BOSS FIGHTERS economy. Each rarity level unlocks exclusive benefits and customization opportunities, allowing players to stand out in the game's competitive ecosystem.


3. STADIUM Store
The STADIUM Store provides owners with a direct way to acquire valuable assets and game resources, bypassing the randomness of Distribution Rounds available for GAME SHARES holders. Purchases are made using Fame Points, a unique currency generated through Stadium activities.

Fame Points 

Earned when battles occur in the owner's Stadium.

Significantly increased when the STADIUM is used during live-streamed games.

Can be purchased with $BFT tokens, adding utility to the token.

Items available in the STADIUM Store depend on the Stadium rarity and may include:

Mystery Boxes

FLEX packs

Cosmetic Collectibles

Game resources & Arena Invites

Gaming Show Features

Other assets

In addition to discounted prices, the Stadium Store enables airdrop functionality, allowing owners to distribute rewards to their livestream audiences or guild members. This makes it a cornerstone of economic and community engagement.


4. Gaming Show Features
If you're a streamer, owning a Stadium takes your content to a new level. With Gaming Show Features, you can turn your audience into active participants, giving them real-time influence over gameplay. Depending on your Stadium's rarity, you can:

Drop power-ups or debuffs directly into the arena.

Apply map-wide modifiers to alter gameplay for all players.

Reward viewers with exclusive resources during live matches.

This interactive engagement not only boosts your viewership but also enhances Fame Point generation, creating a powerful loop between content creation and in-game rewards.

1. The Crafting Process
At its core, crafting allows any in-game item whether it's a Character, a Boss, an Equipment item, or a Skin — ranging from Common to Mythic rarity — to undergo a one-time conversion into a Digital Collectible. This process not only marks the item's entry into the realm of tradability but also reveals its unique Value Perks, making each Collectible a coveted piece within the game's universe.

The crafting journey is full of surprises, especially when it comes to Value Perks. For each odd rarity (Common, Rare, Legendary), Value Perks are assigned randomly, introducing an element of chance into the crafting process. For each even rarity (Uncommon, Epic, Mythic), its Value Perks are upgraded, also at random, with potential enhancements ranging from 1 to 3 stars.

Crafting in BOSS FIGHTERS is designed to be straightforward and accessible. The only requirements for transforming an item into a Digital Collectible are the item itself, a specific amount of $BFT Tokens, and Fusion Cores. With no additional prerequisites, crafting is completed instantly, allowing you to immediately reap the benefits of your newly transformed item.

After finishing the Crafting process, a certain amount of Sponsor Marks will be rewarded to you. Sponsor Marks can be used for merging BADGEs or leveling up CONTRACTs.

2. Trading and Supply Considerations
Once an item has been crafted into a Digital Collectible, it occupies a slot in the total supply of that item type on that rarity level, contributing to the overall economy of BOSS FIGHTERS. These crafted items become tradable on the OpenLoot market, opening up avenues for players to engage in strategic trading. Whether you're looking to complete your collection, acquire a specific Perk, or simply profit from your endeavors, the OpenLoot market serves as a vibrant platform for all your trading needs.

Example:

Let's take a Striker as an example.

You upgraded it to the "Rare" rarity.

At this point, it already has 2 Power Perks (for Common and Rare rarities) and a star upgrade of the 1st Power Perk (for Uncommon rarity).

Now you decide to craft a Digital Collectible.

Once it's done, this Striker receives 2 Value Perks (for Common and Rare rarities) and a random 1-to-3-star upgrade of the first Value Perk (for Uncommon rarity) in addition to existing Power Perks.

On top of that, this exact Striker becomes 1 of 1500 possible Rare Strikers in the form of Digital Collectibles.

Also, this Striker becomes tradable on the OpenLoot.
Merging System
Merging represents a crucial pathway to augmenting your in-game assets and Digital Collectibles, elevating their Rarity, and unlocking new dimensions of gameplay. This intricate system not only allows for the enhancement of item Rarity from Common to Unique but also introduces a nuanced progression of Perks that add both power and value to your items. Here's a deep dive into the Merging System, offering you the insights needed to navigate and leverage this essential feature effectively.

1. Enhancing Rarity Through Merging
The journey of item enhancement in BOSS FIGHTERS is marked by two significant pathways: the transition of in-game assets, which can be merged up to Mythic Rarity, and the evolution of Digital Collectibles, which extend from Common to the coveted Unique Rarity. This tiered approach to item enhancement ensures a rich and varied gameplay experience, providing numerous opportunities for strategic development.

2. Power and Value Perks
Merging unfolds across two parallel lines of progression, distinguishing between Power Perks, which enhance the item's in-game utility, and Value Perks, which increase the item's farming potential. Power Perks emerge with every odd merge — on Common, Rare, and Legendary rarities — up to three times. Conversely, Value Perks, exclusive to Digital Collectibles, unfold across five stages — Common, Rare, Legendary, Exalted, and Transcendent rarities. Each subsequent even Rarity tier brings quality upgrades to these Perks, adding layers of depth and strategy to the Merging process.

3. The Mechanics of Merging
3.1 Merging In-game Assets
The journey of item enhancement through Merging begins with selecting two identical items of the same Rarity. These items are the foundation upon which the new, enhanced item will be built. Along with these items, players are required to invest Cash, the in-game soft currency, setting the stage for the merge.

One of the most strategic aspects of Merging is the handling of Power Perks. As you Merge items, you're presented with the opportunity to lock in one Power Perk for each pair. This decision involves using FLEX, the game’s premium currency, to ensure that your chosen Perk carries over to the newly merged item. If not locked, one of the two Perks in the pair will be chosen randomly for the merged item, adding an element of unpredictability to the process.

When Merging results in an item of odd Rarity, it is bestowed with a new Power Perk. This new Perk introduces a fresh layer of capability to the item, further enhancing the item's power. However, if the newly emerged Perk doesn't align with your strategic preferences, you have the option to reroll it using Variators, another in-game resource, for a chance at a more desirable Perk.

Conversely, items that achieve an even Rarity through Merging receive a quality upgrade to their most recent Power Perk. This upgrade boosts the Perk's effectiveness but, similar to the odd rarity's new Perk, if the upgrade doesn't meet your expectations or needs, you have the opportunity to reroll it for a potentially better outcome using Reinforcers.

3.2 Merging Digital Collectibles
When two Digital Collectibles are merged, the process mirrors that of in-game assets, with the significant addition of Value Perks. These Perks enhance the item's collectible value and farming potential and are subject to the same meticulous decision-making as Power Perks. For each pair of Value Perks, the decision should be made and action taken in parallel with Power Perks.

Merging Digital Collectibles requires not only Cash but also a specified amount of $BFT Tokens and Fusion Cores.

An essential factor to consider during the merge of Digital Collectibles is the availability of supply slots for the newly created item. The process can only proceed if the new item's supply is not fully consumed. Successfully Merging Digital Collectibles frees up the supply slots of the consumed items, making them available once more for the community. This mechanism ensures a balanced and sustainable ecosystem for all players. Additionally, you will receive a certain amount of Sponsor Marks together with the new item.

Dismantle
Dismantling emerges as a vital feature, allowing players to refine their collections by breaking down unnecessary items into valuable components. This process is exclusive to Digital Collectible Items and Cosmetics, providing a strategic avenue for players to optimize their game progress and inventory management.

Dismantling in BOSS FIGHTERS is a straightforward yet impactful process. It enables you to convert Digital Collectible Items and Cosmetics into Fusion Cores. This action is free of charge and instant, emphasizing the game's commitment to items' recirculation in the economy.

The quantity of Fusion Cores obtained through dismantling is directly influenced by the rarity of the item being dismantled. Naturally, higher rarity items yield more Fusion Cores, reflecting their inherent value and the investment made to acquire or enhance them.
